# LLMs_Explainable_Feature_Engineering

## Abstract

Machine learning (ML) are demonstrating remarkable success in a variety of healthcare applications, ranging from diagnostic support and shared decision-making to personalized treatment and patient outcomes. The success of ML in healthcare is inherently linked to the rigorous process of feature engineering and feature selection, which truly form the backbone of ML model development. The main objectives of this study are to investigate the role of large language models (LLMs), and in particular ChatGPT 3.5, in the feature selection and ranking processes as a part of ML explainability within the healthcare domain. The study aims to explore how these computational models can contribute to the feature engineering process and enhance the understanding of feature importance utilizing healthcare datasets. To conduct an exploration of ChatGPT 3.5's potential in feature engineering, this study leverages two distinct datasets, including <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/data/" target="_blank">SEER</a> dataset as well as the <a href="https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/data-and-registries/acs-nsqip//" target="_blank">NSQIP</a>, as two widely-used and well-established healthcare datasets. This contribution also runs a comparative study to compare the performance of ChatGPT 3.5 with traditional ML-based feature engineering methods, such as Information Gain (IG), Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The current study involves employing ChatGPT 3.5 to aid in the selection of the most important features and classification using these features. The methods will focus on understanding how ChatGPT 3.5 can be integrated into the feature engineering pipeline to improve the interpretability and explainability of ML models in healthcare.
